Scope of the DEI.md File

Our project prioritizes and reflects on DEI through a regular review of project policies and performance. This 
reflection is documented in the following DEI.md file based on specific [CHAOSS project](https://chaoss.community) 
DEI metrics. 

### [Project Access](https://chaoss.community/?p=4953)
Project access is addressed in our project through various efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support access for 
all. Specific efforts in our project include:
* Our Django Fellows span global time zones and work asynchronously with contributors across the world.
* The Django documentation and the Django framework itself has multiple translations.
* All areas of Django are considered open to community contributions, including joining a translation team, conference 
organising or volunteering, running for the Django Software Foundation (DSF) board, Django ticket triage etc.
* DSF membership, which recognizes contributors to Django, is open to non-code contributors, including contributions 
through events, blog posts, and comments in issues and merge requests.
* We have an Accessibility Team dedicated to improving the accessibility of Django.
* DjangoCons offer opportunity grants to make the conferences accessible to those who are new and/or financially 
constrained.
* DjangoCons make it a priority to offer childcare reimbursements and private facilities for breastfeeding.
* DjangoCon talks have in place human captioners which make talks more accessible - especially to those hard of hearing 
and language learners.

_Note: the extra provisions and opportunity grants are only possible at DjangoCons due to our generous sponsors. 
DjangoCons have diversity and accessibility packages which allow sponsors to specifically fund these efforts._
  
### [Communication Transparency](https://chaoss.community/?p=4957)
Communication Transparency is addressed in our project through a variety of different efforts. Through these efforts, we 
aim to support transparency for all. Specific efforts in our project include: 
* All project documentation is publicly available at [djangoproject.com](https://djangoproject.com).
* Decisions that impact Django are shared via the DSF Board 
[meeting minutes](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/minutes/).
* [Statistics of Code of Conduct reports](https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/blob/main/statistics.md) are 
publicly available.
* DjangoCon talks are publicly available - [DjangoCon Europe](https://www.youtube.com/@djangoconeurope), 
[DjangoCon US](https://www.youtube.com/@DjangoConUS)
* [Trac (Django's ticketing system)](https://code.djangoproject.com/query) is publicly available. All actions are open 
including creating new tickets, commenting on and updating existing tickets (with a GitHub account).
* The [Django forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/) hosts discussions where anyone can post, comment and like (with a 
GitHub account).
* The [Django Discord](https://discord.gg/xcRH6mN4fa) is publicly available (with a Discord account).
           
### [Newcomer Experiences](https://chaoss.community/?p=4891)
The newcomer experience is addressed in our project through a variety of different efforts. Through these efforts, we 
aim to support the newcomer experience for all new members. Specific efforts in our project include:
* A quick start guide for newcomers is available on our website and made available through the main website navigation.
* Django has an automatic welcome message for first time contributors to Django who are awaiting a response to a merge 
request.
* Django's contributor documentation includes a full walkthrough tutorial for newcomers to make their first 
contribution. This includes setting up the development environment, making code changes, documentation updates and ways 
to find support.
* Django conferences welcome and prioritise new speakers.
* The [Django forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/) and [Django Discord](https://discord.gg/xcRH6mN4fa) have 
dedicated support channels and active moderators.
* [Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space/) is a mentorship program aiming develop future leaders of Django.
  
### [Inclusive Leadership](https://chaoss.community/?p=3522)
Inclusive leadership is addressed in our project through a variety of different efforts. Through these efforts, we aim 
to support leadership opportunities for project members with an interest. Specific efforts in our project include: 
* DSF Board members have limited terms which require a renewal via a community vote. Everyone in the community can run 
to be a member of the Board.
* Django is community run. All decision-making/leadership responsibilities are help by groups rather than individuals.
* The DSF membership has historically and continues to elect members for the 
[DSF Board](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/#board) that are diverse in terms of gender, age, race, geography, 
and more.
* The Code of Conduct committee enforces the code of conduct consistently.

Our project recognizes that the inclusion of the DEI.md file and the provided reflection on the specific DEI metrics 
does not ensure community safety nor community inclusiveness. The inclusion of the DEI.md file signals that we, as a 
project, are committed to centering DEI in our project and regularly reviewing and reflecting on our project DEI 
practices.

If you do not feel that the DEI.md file appropriately addresses concerns you have about community safety and 
inclusiveness, please let us know. You can do this by reporting your concerns to our 
[Code of Conduct team](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/committees/#conduct) to raise concerns you have.
